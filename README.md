# renpyls

Language server for Ren'Py language.

This is derived from the source code for this Medium article ["Implementing a Language Server…How Hard Can It Be?? — Part 2"](https://medium.com/ballerina-techblog/implementing-a-language-server-how-hard-can-it-be-part-2-fa65a741aa23). It's a part of a 3-Part-Series where [Nipuna Marcus](https://medium.com/@nipunamarcus2) walksthrough the process of setting up a simple Language Server via [LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j), the "Java implementation of the language server protocol".
